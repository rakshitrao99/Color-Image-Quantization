# Color-Image-Quantization
* Implemented different adaptive, tapered quantizations algorithms for color images like uniform quantization, popularity algorithm and median cut, and produced high-quality reproduction of color images with small frame buffer.
* Implemented Floyd-Steinberg dithering algorithm on these quantization algorithms and analyzed their performance.
